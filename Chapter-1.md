Any mathematical equation relating to physical quantities must be **dimensionally consistent**, which means the equation must obey the following rules\:

- The expressions on each side of the equality in an equation must have the same dimensions

- The arguments of any of the standard mathematical functions such as trigonometric functions (such as sine and cosine), logarithms, or exponential functions that appear in the equation must be dimensionless.
These functions require pure numbers as inputs and give pure numbers as outputs

If either of these rules is violated, an equation is not dimensionally consistent and cannot possibly be a correct
statement of physical law.
