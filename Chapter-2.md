# Chapter 2 - Vectors

## Equations

- $A = |\vec{A}|$

- $\vec{A} = \vec{A_x} + \vec{A_y}$

- $\vec{C} = \vec{A} + \vec{B}$

- $\vec{C_x} = \vec{A_x} + \vec{B_x}$ and $\vec{C_y} = \vec{A_y} + \vec{B_y}$

**Dot Product**

- $\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = ABcos{\theta}$

- $\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = A_xB_x+A_yB_y$

**Cross Product**

- Magnitude of cross product = $|\vec{A}\times\vec{B}| = ABsin\theta$

- $\vec{C} = \vec{A}\times\vec{B}$

## 2.1 Scalars and Vectors

- **Scalar Quantities** - A quantity that is simply a number. Time, mass, distance, length, volume, temperature, and energy are all *scalar quantities*.

- **Vector Quantities** - Physical quantities specified completely by giving a number of units (magnitude) and a direction are called *vector quantities*. Examples of vector quantities include displacement, velocity, position, force and torque.

## 2.3 Algebra of Vectors

- Vectors can be added using components. Add the $x$ components and $y$ components to get the new vector.

- Unit vectors are vectors of length 1 along the $x, y, z$ axes and are $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, and $\hat{k}$ respectively

## 2.4 Products of Vectors

- The dot product of $\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}$ is $ABcos{\theta}$ where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors. The dot product is a scalar

- THe cross product of two vectors produces a third vector which is perpendicular to the plane containing the two vectors. It's magnitude is $|\vec{A}\times\vec{B}| = ABsin\theta$
